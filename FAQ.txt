Q: Compiling KylinBurner fails with errors like this:
   base_kylin burneradvanceddataimagesettings.cpp:185: invalid use of undefined type
   `struct KComboBox'
   base_kylin burneradvanceddataimagesettings.h:17: forward declaration of `struct
   KComboBox'
A: The QTDesigner tool 'uic' is not able to find the kde widget plugins.
   To solve this run 'qtconfig' and add '$KDEDIR/lib/kde3/plugins' to the plugin search path
   (replace $KDEDIR with your kde base dir).


Q: Where has all the fancy graphic gone?
A: Most likely you installed KylinBurner in the wrong directory. All KDE programs are installed in the
   KDE dirtree (SuSE: /opt/kde3, RedHat: /usr). If you compile KylinBurner from source it defaults
   to either $KDEDIR or /usr/local. To install in the correct directory you need to specify the prefix
   to configure like this:
     ./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`
   That will install KylinBurner relative to the correct path.


Q: The linking always breaks with the missing -laudio.
A: You need to install NAS.


Q: Where can I find KylinBurnerSetup2?
A: KylinBurnerSetup2 is a KControlCenter Module. You can find it in the System Administration section or start
   it manually with "kdesu kcmshell4 kylin burnersetup2".
   There also is a script since KylinBurner 0.11 called kylin burnersetup.


Q: My writer supports writing at speed X but KylinBurner shows Y as a max.
A: KylinBurner determined the maximum writing speed the first time you start it. Since the speed reported by the
   writer always depends on the mounted medium this may not be the real max.
   To manually change it open the KylinBurner settings in the device section and click on the value. You will
   be presented with a spinbox which allows one to change the speed.


Q: Writing fails with the following cdrecord message:
     "Cannot allocate memory. Cannot get SCSI I/O buffer."
A: Since kernel 2.6.9 suid root programs are not allowed to use the SCSI subsystem.
   To solve this issue either configure cdrecord to run without root privileges: chmod 755 /usr/bin/cdrecord
   or run KylinBurner as root (which is not recommended but works also).


Q: Writing fails with the following cdrecord message over and over again:
     "Error trying to open /dev/hdc exclusively (Device or resource busy)..."
A: You are using a patched cdrecord version which tries to open the device exclusively which fails because
   your are probably also using automounting. The solutions are to disable automounting altogether (and this is
   the recommended solution as automounting can cause other more serious problems with CD/DVD writing) or to
   install a non-patched cdrecord version.

Q: My DVD drive supports 16X but K3B keeps burning at 1X! What's happening?

A: Your kernel most likely didn't apply optimal settings for your drive when it detected it. You can find out
   what are the current settings of your drive with the command "hdparm -v /dev/dvd":

   /dev/dvd:
    IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
    unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
    using_dma    =  0 (off)
    keepsettings =  0 (off)
    readonly     =  0 (off)
    readahead    = 256 (on)

   The following options are known to maximize burning and playback performance:

     hdparm -d1 -c1 -a8 -u1 /dev/dvd

   To make these options permanent, a quick and dirty solution is to include the command in /etc/rc.local.
   Consult your distribution documentation for a tailored solution.

   Some drives have buggy DMA support. If you experience instability, leave these options disabled.
