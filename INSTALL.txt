Installing KylinBurner 18.04.0
----------------------


What you need to run KylinBurner:
 mandatory:
  - since KylinBurner is a CD writing program a cd writer would be a good thing to have ;-)
  - the QT5 library (at least version 5.6)
  - the KDE5 libraries (at least version 5.24.0)
  - the cdparanoia library for cd ripping from Monty
  - the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs) from Joerg Schilling
  - the dvd+rw-tools by Andy Polyakov for DVD writing

 optional:
  - cdrdao, the other linux cd writing program from Andreas Mueller
  - the transcode tools for DVD ripping and DivX/XviD encoding from Thomas Oestreich
  - vcdimager >= 0.7 for creating video cds
  - libmad for mp3 decoding
  - ogg-vorbis libraries for encoding and decoding
  - the FLAC++ libraries for flac-decoding
  - the eMovix package
  - TagLib by Scott Wheeler for reading Meta data tags
  - the musepack (or now mpcdec) library for decoding Musepack audio files
  - the ffmpeg library to decode other audio file formats such as wma
  - the sndfile library to decode audio file formats such as AIFF or VOC
  - the lame library to encode audio files in the mp3 format
  - sox to encode audio files in formats such as AIFF or VOC
  - a dynamically compiled libffmpeg for wma decoding
  - the musicbrainz library for metadata queries for single audio titles
  - polkit-qt for KylinBurnerSetup (tool for changing permissions of programs and devices)

After that it's all the same:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..

For debug:

  static analyzer:
  scan-build -k -v -V cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr    \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib    \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR=lib    \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON   \
    -DK3B_BUILD_API_DOCS=ON \
    -DK3B_DEBUG=ON

  dynamic analyzer and fuzzer:
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr    \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++    \
    -DECM_ENABLE_SANITIZERS='address;undefined'    \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize-coverage=edge,indirect-calls,8bit-counters,trace-bb,trace-cmp" \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib    \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR=lib    \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON   \
    -DK3B_BUILD_API_DOCS=ON \
    -DK3B_DEBUG=ON

If the cmake run was successful you are presented with a list of configure results that shows
which optional features are enabled. Now just compile KylinBurner:

  make

  if for static analyzer:
  scan-build -k -v -v -v -V make

Now you are ready to install:

  make install (as root)
